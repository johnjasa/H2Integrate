    Attributes:
        n_control_window_hours (int): Length of each rolling optimization window
            in hours. The state of charge at the end of one window becomes the
            initial state of charge of the next. Defaults to 24.
        n_commit_window_hours (int | None): Number of hours kept from each solved
            window before the horizon advances. Every solve looks ahead a full
            window but only the leading ``n_commit_window_hours`` are written
            out, so the end-of-horizon boundary never reaches the committed
            schedule. Shortening it costs ``n_control_window_hours /
            n_commit_window_hours`` times more solves. Setting it equal to
            ``n_control_window_hours`` recovers non-overlapping blocks, which
            leaves storage with no reason to carry a charge across a boundary.
            Defaults to None, which uses a quarter of the control window.
        cost_per_tech (dict): Marginal-cost specification for each dispatchable
            technology, using the same syntax as ``CostMinimizationControl``.
            Each entry may be a numeric value, ``"buy_price"``, ``"VarOpEx"``,
            or ``"feedstock"``. Defaults to an empty dict.
        value_of_lost_load (float): Penalty applied to unmet demand, in
            ``USD/(commodity_rate_unit*h)``. Acts as the price of the unmet-demand
            slack variable that keeps the linear program feasible. Defaults to
            10.0 (that is, ``$10/kWh`` for electricity).
        storage_cycle_cost (float): Cost applied to storage throughput (charge
            plus discharge), in ``USD/(commodity_rate_unit*h)``. Represents
            degradation and breaks ties between equivalent dispatch schedules.
            Defaults to 0.0.
        export_limit_component (str | None): Name of a demand component whose
            unmet demand caps exports at each timestep, in addition to the
            export technology's interconnection size. Used to value an addition
            against only the demand an existing plant leaves unserved. Defaults
            to None, which applies the interconnection size alone.
        surplus_source_component (str | None): Name of a demand component whose
            unused output is made available to the controlled technologies, so
            an added storage technology can absorb an existing plant's spilled
            production. Defaults to None.
        solver_name (str): Pyomo solver used to solve each window. Defaults to
            ``"glpk"``.
        solver_options (dict): Additional options passed through to the solver.
            Defaults to an empty dict.

class LPArbitrageControl(SystemLevelControlBase):
    """System-level controller that co-optimizes dispatch with a linear program.

    Solves a rolling-horizon linear program that maximizes plant profit against
    a time-varying sale price (for example, a locational marginal price series).
    It is aimed at solar-plus-storage arbitrage but is written generically over
    the technology classifiers, so any mix of fixed, flexible, dispatchable, and
    storage technologies on a single commodity bus is supported.

    Unlike the heuristic controllers, which apply a fixed
    fixed -> flexible -> storage -> dispatchable priority order, this controller
    decides storage charge/discharge, dispatchable output, and grid export
    *simultaneously*. That matters for arbitrage, because whether it is worth
    charging in a given hour depends on what the dispatchable technologies would
    otherwise cost in the hours the storage would later discharge into.

    **Decision variables** (per timestep, per rolling window):

    - ``charge[s]`` / ``discharge[s]`` for each storage technology, in
      commodity rate units on the *bus* side of the storage (this matches the
      sign convention of the storage performance model, whose command value is
      also bus-side).
    - ``soc[s]``, the stored quantity in commodity amount units.
    - ``dispatch[d]`` for each dispatchable technology, bounded by its rated
      production.
    - ``export``, the quantity sold through the export technology, bounded by
      that technology's interconnection size and, if ``export_limit_component``
      is set, by that component's unmet demand in the same timestep.
    - ``curtail``, surplus that cannot be exported because the interconnection
      is saturated.
    - ``unmet``, a demand shortfall slack penalized at ``value_of_lost_load``.
      This exists so the program is always feasible; a well-posed plant should
      converge with ``unmet`` at zero.

    **Objective** (maximized)::

        sum_t dt * (  sell_price[t] * export[t]
                    - sum_d marginal_cost[d, t] * dispatch[d, t]
                    - value_of_lost_load * unmet[t]
                    - storage_cycle_cost * sum_s (charge[s, t] + discharge[s, t]) )

    **Constraints**:

    1. Commodity balance at each timestep.
    2. Storage state-of-charge dynamics, including charge/discharge efficiency.
    3. Dispatchable output bounded by rated production.
    4. Total charging bounded by the commodity actually available on the bus.
       This mirrors the ``charge_available`` clip inside the storage performance
       model, so the schedule the controller commands is one the storage model
       can actually follow.

    Fixed and flexible technologies are treated as must-run parameters rather
    than decision variables. Flexible performance models (wind, solar) are
    resource-driven and do not respond to a set-point, so their output is
    availability, not a choice. Economic curtailment is therefore represented by
    the ``curtail`` variable rather than by lowering a set-point.

    Charging from the grid is permitted: the ``dispatch`` of an import
    technology raises the right-hand side of the charge-availability
    constraint. For this to be physically realizable the plant topology must
    actually route the import technology into the storage technology's
    commodity input.

    **Valuing an addition to an existing plant**

    Setting ``export_limit_component`` and ``surplus_source_component`` to an
    existing plant's demand component restricts the controlled technologies to
    that plant's leftovers, which isolates the value of the addition. The
    demand component guarantees that unmet demand and unused production are
    never simultaneously nonzero, so the two signals compose cleanly: in a
    deficit timestep the addition may sell up to the shortfall, and in a
    surplus timestep the export ceiling is zero, so the spilled production can
    only be stored or curtailed rather than resold. Note that this holds the
    existing plant's dispatch fixed, which is a good approximation only while
    the addition is small enough not to change how that plant would run.

    Configuration is read from
    ``plant_config["system_level_control"]["control_parameters"]``. The export
    technology is named by ``plant_config["system_level_control"]["export_component"]``
    and its ``{commodity}_sell_price`` input or output supplies the price series.

    **Generalization TODOs**

    This formulation was written against a solar-plus-battery electricity
    arbitrage plant, and several deliberate simplifications follow from that
    scope. They are collected here so the work needed to support other storage
    or dispatchable technologies is visible in one place. Individual methods
    carry the corresponding detail.

    TODO: Generalize to multiple commodities. The linear program builds a single
    balance constraint on ``self.commodity``, so a plant that stores hydrogen
    and sells electricity, or that runs a converter linking two buses, cannot be
    represented. Supporting that means indexing the balance, export, and
    curtailment variables by commodity and adding conversion constraints that
    couple them.

    TODO: Generalize to a single export technology per commodity. The objective
    values all sales at one price through one interconnection. Plants that sell
    into several markets, or that face separate import and export nodes with
    different prices, need one export variable and price series per sales point.
    TODO: Generalize the storage model. See :meth:`_read_storage_parameters` and
    :meth:`_build_lp_model` for the specific assumptions (lossless standby,
    symmetric efficiency split, no ramp or minimum-power limits) that hold for a
    lithium-ion battery but not for hydrogen, thermal, or pumped-hydro storage.

    TODO: Generalize the dispatchable model. Every dispatchable technology is
    assumed to be continuously adjustable between zero and rated production at
    a linear marginal cost. Thermal units, electrolyzers, and industrial loads
    generally have minimum stable operating points, start-up costs, and minimum
    up and down times, none of which a linear program can express. See
    :meth:`_build_lp_model`.

    TODO: Generalize the treatment of flexible technologies. They are pinned to
    must-run parameters because the wind and solar performance models ignore
    their command value. A flexible technology that does honor a set-point
    should instead become a bounded decision variable so the optimizer can
    curtail it directly. See :meth:`compute`.

        The model is constructed once and re-solved for every window with
        updated mutable parameters, which avoids rebuilding Pyomo objects
        thousands of times over the course of a nonlinear solver loop.

        TODO: Generalize the balance constraint past one commodity. ``balance``
        treats the plant as a single lumped bus carrying ``self.commodity``.
        Storing a different commodity than the one that is sold, or placing a
        converter between two buses, requires one balance constraint per
        commodity plus conversion terms linking them.

        TODO: Generalize ``charge_availability``. It bounds total charging by
        the commodity present on that same lumped bus, mirroring the
        ``charge_available`` clip inside the storage performance model. It
        therefore assumes every source can physically reach every storage
        technology. A plant where only part of the generation is routed to a
        given store needs the constraint written per storage technology over its
        actual upstream connections.

        TODO: Generalize the storage dynamics in ``soc_balance``. The state of
        charge evolves only through commanded charge and discharge at constant
        efficiency. Self-discharge, boil-off, standby loads, ramp limits, and
        efficiency that varies with power or state of charge would each add
        terms here, and the last of those is nonlinear unless it is
        piecewise-linearized.

        TODO: Generalize ``rated_limit`` for dispatchable technologies with
        commitment behavior. Output is bounded only from above by a single rated
        value, so any unit is free to sit anywhere between zero and rated in
        every timestep. Minimum stable generation, start-up and shutdown costs,
        and minimum up and down times all require binary commitment variables,
        which turns this into a mixed-integer program and rules out the
        continuous solvers assumed by ``solver_name``.

        TODO: Revisit simultaneous charge and discharge if the objective gains
        terms that can make it profitable. The linear relaxation permits it, and
        it is currently ruled out only because it is never optimal when prices
        and ``storage_cycle_cost`` are such that cycling costs money. Negative
        prices combined with ancillary-service revenue could break that, and
        forbidding it needs a binary variable per storage technology per
        timestep.
