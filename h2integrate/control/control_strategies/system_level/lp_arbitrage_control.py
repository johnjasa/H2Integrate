        value_of_lost_load (float): Penalty applied to unmet demand, in

class LPArbitrageControl(SystemLevelControlBase):
    """System-level controller that co-optimizes dispatch with a linear program.

    Solves a rolling-horizon linear program that maximizes plant profit against
    a time-varying sale price (for example, a locational marginal price series).
    It is aimed at solar-plus-storage arbitrage but is written generically over
    the technology classifiers, so any mix of fixed, flexible, dispatchable, and
    storage technologies on a single commodity bus is supported.

    Unlike the heuristic controllers, which apply a fixed
    fixed -> flexible -> storage -> dispatchable priority order, this controller
    decides storage charge/discharge, dispatchable output, and grid export
    *simultaneously*. That matters for arbitrage, because whether it is worth
    charging in a given hour depends on what the dispatchable technologies would
    otherwise cost in the hours the storage would later discharge into.

    **Decision variables** (per timestep, per rolling window):

    - ``charge[s]`` / ``discharge[s]`` for each storage technology, in
      commodity rate units on the *bus* side of the storage (this matches the
      sign convention of the storage performance model, whose command value is
      also bus-side).
    - ``soc[s]``, the stored quantity in commodity amount units.
    - ``dispatch[d]`` for each dispatchable technology, bounded by its rated
      production.
    - ``export``, the quantity sold through the export technology, bounded by
      that technology's interconnection size.
    - ``curtail``, surplus that cannot be exported because the interconnection
      is saturated.
    - ``unmet``, a demand shortfall slack penalized at ``value_of_lost_load``.
      This exists so the program is always feasible; a well-posed plant should
      converge with ``unmet`` at zero.

    **Objective** (maximized)::

        sum_t dt * (  sell_price[t] * export[t]
                    - sum_d marginal_cost[d, t] * dispatch[d, t]
                    - value_of_lost_load * unmet[t]
                    - storage_cycle_cost * sum_s (charge[s, t] + discharge[s, t]) )
        + sum_s terminal_price[s] * soc[s, last]

    **Constraints**:

    1. Commodity balance at each timestep.
    2. Storage state-of-charge dynamics, including charge/discharge efficiency.
    3. Dispatchable output bounded by rated production.
    4. Total charging bounded by the commodity actually available on the bus.
       This mirrors the ``charge_available`` clip inside the storage performance
       model, so the schedule the controller commands is one the storage model
       can actually follow.

    Fixed and flexible technologies are treated as must-run parameters rather
    than decision variables. Flexible performance models (wind, solar) are
    resource-driven and do not respond to a set-point, so their output is
    availability, not a choice. Economic curtailment is therefore represented by
    the ``curtail`` variable rather than by lowering a set-point.

    Charging from the grid is permitted: the ``dispatch`` of an import
    technology raises the right-hand side of the charge-availability
    constraint. For this to be physically realizable the plant topology must
    actually route the import technology into the storage technology's
    commodity input.

    Configuration is read from
    ``plant_config["system_level_control"]["control_parameters"]``. The export
    technology is named by ``plant_config["system_level_control"]["export_component"]``
    and its ``electricity_sell_price`` supplies the price series.

    **Generalization TODOs**

    This formulation was written against a solar-plus-battery electricity
    arbitrage plant, and several deliberate simplifications follow from that
    scope. They are collected here so the work needed to support other storage
    or dispatchable technologies is visible in one place. Individual methods
    carry the corresponding detail.

    TODO: Generalize to multiple commodities. The linear program builds a single
    balance constraint on ``self.commodity``, so a plant that stores hydrogen
    and sells electricity, or that runs a converter linking two buses, cannot be
    represented. Supporting that means indexing the balance, export, and
    curtailment variables by commodity and adding conversion constraints that
    couple them.

    TODO: Generalize to a single export technology per commodity. The objective
    values all sales at one price through one interconnection. Plants that sell
    into several markets, or that face separate import and export nodes with
    different prices, need one export variable and price series per sales point.

    TODO: Generalize the storage model. See :meth:`_read_storage_parameters` and
    :meth:`_build_lp_model` for the specific assumptions (lossless standby,
    symmetric efficiency split, static sizing, no ramp or minimum-power limits)
    that hold for a lithium-ion battery but not for hydrogen, thermal, or
    pumped-hydro storage.

    TODO: Generalize the dispatchable model. Every dispatchable technology is
    assumed to be continuously adjustable between zero and rated production at
    a linear marginal cost. Thermal units, electrolyzers, and industrial loads
    generally have minimum stable operating points, start-up costs, and minimum
    up and down times, none of which a linear program can express. See
    :meth:`_build_lp_model`.

    TODO: Generalize the treatment of flexible technologies. They are pinned to
    must-run parameters because the wind and solar performance models ignore
    their command value. A flexible technology that does honor a set-point
    should instead become a bounded decision variable so the optimizer can
    curtail it directly. See :meth:`compute`.
